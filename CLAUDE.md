# Aira AI — Claude Code Operating Manual

## Identity
Generic B2B SaaS — any business that does WhatsApp lead-gen + telecalling.
North Star: no single block/flag/outage stops a client's lead-gen for >5 minutes.
Solo dev. Terse. Code over prose. No trailing summaries. No explanations unless asked.

## Hard Invariants — Never Break
1. Lead score always integer 1–10
2. Segments: A=Hot, B=Warm, C=Cold, D=Disqualified — labels immutable
3. WhatsApp 24h session window — approved templates only outside window
4. All segment lists: GET /api/v1/leads?segment=A&format=csv
5. Call recordings → Supabase Storage only, never local disk
6. Tenant isolation enforced at app layer via `get_tenant_and_role()` — DB-level RLS not yet enabled
7. Bulk-send endpoint rejects leads with null opt_in_source
8. **Template submission** always uses `meta_waba_id` (NOT `meta_phone_number_id`)
9. AI model is Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` — do NOT add Gemini/OpenAI imports
10. WhatsApp webhook verifies X-Hub-Signature-256 before processing — returns 200 but drops invalid

## Stack
| Layer | Tech | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | FastAPI, Python 3.11+, Pydantic v2 | backend/app/ |
| DB | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime) | — |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind | frontend/app/dashboard/ |
| AI (replies + scoring) | Groq — llama-3.3-70b-versatile | services/ai_reply.py, lead_scorer.py |
| WhatsApp | Meta Cloud API Direct | — |
| Voice | TeleCMI click-to-call + recording | services/telecmi_client.py |
| Payments | Razorpay Payment Links API | services/payment_razorpay.py |
| Scheduler | APScheduler (AsyncIO) — automations, broadcasts, token health | app/main.py |
| Cache | In-process prompt cache (60s TTL) | ai_reply.py:_prompt_cache |

## Provider Decisions (locked)
- WhatsApp: Meta Cloud API Direct
- Voice: TeleCMI
- AI (replies + scoring): Groq / llama-3.3-70b-versatile (NOT Gemini)
- Payments: Razorpay (Payment Links API — no SDK, direct httpx calls)

## Supabase Config (production)
- Project ID: `ayftynkgmfkaqmmnlmoc`
- Region: ap-northeast-1
- WABA ID in app_settings: `meta_waba_id = 994218516456571`
- Default tenant: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

## Render Config (production)
- Backend URL: `https://aira-ai-5tfr.onrender.com`
- WhatsApp webhook: `https://aira-ai-5tfr.onrender.com/webhook/whatsapp`
- Instagram webhook: `https://aira-ai-5tfr.onrender.com/webhook/instagram/{tenant_id}`
- Facebook webhook: `https://aira-ai-5tfr.onrender.com/webhook/facebook/{tenant_id}`
- Telegram webhook: `https://aira-ai-5tfr.onrender.com/webhook/telegram/{tenant_id}`

## APScheduler Jobs (all in main.py)
| Job | Interval | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| _process_automation_waits | 5 min | Resume automation wait-step executions |
| _process_scheduled_broadcasts | 1 min | Fire pending scheduled_broadcasts rows |
| _check_token_health | 24 h | Validate Meta tokens, create token_invalid incidents |
| _sync_all_number_quality | 24 h | Sync Meta number quality rating & limits |

## Task Router — Read This File Before Acting
| Task involves | Read first |
|---|---|
| WhatsApp, Meta API, provider layer, phone_numbers | backend/app/routes/webhook.py + services/meta_cloud.py + services/outbound_router.py |
| Telecalling, TeleCMI, call logs, notes, briefing modal | backend/app/routes/calls.py + services/telecmi_client.py + services/call_summarizer.py |
| Leads, scoring, segments, opt-in | backend/app/routes/leads.py + services/scoring_engine.py (v2) + services/lead_scorer.py (legacy, AI-disabled path) |
| Number pool, failover, Numbers page, Incidents page | backend/app/routes/numbers.py + services/failover.py + routes/incidents.py |
| CSV upload, bulk send, scheduled/drip broadcasts | backend/app/routes/upload.py + services/broadcast_executor.py |
| Bookings, booking flow, Razorpay payments | backend/app/services/booking_flow.py + routes/bookings.py |
| WhatsApp templates, Meta template API | backend/app/routes/templates.py + services/meta_cloud.py |
| Settings, channel activation, token health | backend/app/routes/app_settings.py |

## Agent Dispatch
Spawn sub-agents automatically for tasks with 2+ independent work units.
Parallel pattern: schema + API route + frontend page → all 3 in one message.

## Settings Page — Fully Configurable
All channel credentials (WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook/Telegram/TeleCMI/Groq) editable in Settings UI.
InboxConfigPanel: escalation on/off, auto-assign, per-trigger (A–F), per-segment (A/B/C/D).
TelecallingConfigPanel: module on/off, auto-assign, per-segment assignment (A/B/C/D), channels.

## Known Tech Debt
- RLS DISABLED on 43 tables — app-layer tenant filter is only guard (Supabase advisory flagged 43)

## Bot Flow Builder (replaces Automations UI)
Visual WhatsApp flow builder at /dashboard/automations (sidebar "Bot Flows"). Backend
extends the automations engine IN PLACE (no renames); "Bot Flow" is a UI name only.
- Engine: `services/automation_engine.py` — resumable step-pointer state machine driven
  by `automation_flow_runs` (`_drive_run`, `_next_step_id`, `resume_due_flow_runs` with
  stale-running reaper). `{{var}}` interpolation reads the run's variable bag.
- Pause-on-reply: `services/flow_runtime.resume_for_inbound` — intercepts inbound in all
  4 channels (webhook/telegram/instagram/facebook) BEFORE trigger fan-out + generate_reply;
  user_input/interactive nodes pause as `waiting_reply`. CAS-guarded against double-drive.
- Blocks: send_message/image/video/file/location, cta_url, template, wait, condition,
  user_input, interactive (N-way button branch = button id), http_api (SSRF-guarded),
  random. Per-node analytics (sent/delivered/error) on automation_steps.
- Specs: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-bot-flow-builder-design.md (Phase 1) +
  -phase2-design.md (run-state, pause-on-reply, power blocks, residual risks).
