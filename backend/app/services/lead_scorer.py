Score this message from a prospect (1-10 integer):
{rubric}

IMPORTANT: Use the context to understand the message.
- A short reply like "ok", "yes", or "thank you" AFTER completing a booking flow or providing requested info = high intent (8-10)
- The same message as a first contact or without context = neutral/low (3-5)
- If the user is actively engaged in a booking flow (providing name, rasi, address, etc.) = warm/high (7-10)
- "ok" or "thank you" during an active booking flow = acknowledgment of progress, not disinterest (7-9)
- A message requesting communication in a regional language (Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, etc.) is an ENGAGEMENT SIGNAL — score minimum 5, never penalise for a language switch request.
- Non-English messages carry the same weight as equivalent English expressions. "ஆமா வேணும்" = "yes I want it" = high intent if context supports it. "சிம்மம்" answering a rasi question = a valid answer — score based on conversational context, not message length or language.

CONTEXT:
{context_block}

Previous score: {current_score}
Message: "{message}"

Reply with ONLY a single integer between 1 and 10. No explanation."""
